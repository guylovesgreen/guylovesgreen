                <p>My name is Xerxes Troy D. Hadjaruddin, you may think my name is so long. Well in reality it's just "Xerxes" that the name my dad had planned for me but my my grandmother wanted to add "Troy" because she just felt like it? Now my name is like a crossword puzzle that I have to spell correctly. Most people pronounce it improperly and I think I'm the only one who actually knows how to say it, I mean who wouldn't struggle saying a name like that?... because it's actually pronounced as "serk-ses" since my name has a couple of X's in it.</p>
                <p>It was a peaceful starry night when I was born in December 11, 2007 in Jolo Sulu, Philippines. After I had reached at age the of 2 years old, we then moved from Mindanao to Luzon and lived there for almost 7 years. Specifically our place was in Bulacan. 
I loved it there, it was where I spent most time of my childhood that makes me feel nostalgic even just having a thought of it.
Unfortunately, my family sooner moved here in Zamboanga where my relatives lived. It was a lot of adjusting that I had to process just to live, from the place to the language that is only spoken in here. But as time passed, I grew out of it and I've been studying here since then..</p>
